# Dynamic Graph or Static Graph - How Does Your Model Think?

When we build a machine learning model, it doesn’t just “run” -
it performs a series of computational operations represented as a graph.
But how exactly is this graph constructed - ahead of time or in real-time?
This is where the distinction between Dynamic Graph and Static Graph comes in.

## Dynamic Graph

The graph is built during runtime, with each step added in real-time.
In other words - every time you feed data, the system “redraws” the computational path.

### Example:

In PyTorch or JAX (in Eager Execution mode), every operation you write in code is immediately translated into computation.
Want to change logic? Add a condition? Just write it - and it works.

### Advantages:

- High flexibility - Easy to debug and modify during development.
- Intuitive - The code looks like regular Python.

### Disadvantages:

- Less optimization.
- The graph needs to be “built and torn down” each time - less efficient in production.

## Static Graph

Here, the graph is built before runtime.
The model goes through a “compilation” stage - built once, then runs quickly and repeatedly.

### Example:

In TensorFlow 1.x or ONNX, you define all the model layers and their flow in advance.
Afterward, you can run the same graph repeatedly with different data.

### Advantages:

- High performance - The system can perform optimizations in advance.
- Suitable for inference and production deployment.

### Disadvantages:

- Less flexible for changes during runtime.
- Requires a separate “compilation” stage.

## When to Use Each?

| Scenario          | Dynamic Graph | Static Graph     |
|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Research & Development | Yes         | Less suitable    |
| Production / Inference | Less efficient | Recommended  |
| Writing Convenience | Very        | Requires pre-definition |
| Performance        | Moderate      | Very high        |

## Bottom Line:

Dynamic Graph gives you control and flexibility,
while Static Graph gives you speed and efficiency.
Advanced systems combine the two - to enjoy the benefits of both.
